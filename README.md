### Notes For Some Features
- MixinExtras is included. Remove `MixinExtrasBootstrap.init();` in `MixinConfigPlugin.java` and `shadow(annotationProcessor("io.github.llamalad7:mixinextras-common:${project.mixinextras_version}"))` in dependencies if you don't need it.
- TaskPublishCurseForge is set up, turn to GitHub actions for easy publishing -- Don't forget to write CurseForge project id in `gradle.properties`
- When porting between 1.16.5 & 1.18.2 & 1.19.2 & 1.20.1 forge, just change the `minecraft_version` in `gradle.properties`. Corresponding forge & java & parchment version is auto-adapted in `build.gradle`
